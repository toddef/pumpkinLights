This is an arduino project using LED lights for jack-o-lanterns. 

Using ALITOVE DC 12V WS2811 Led Pixel for lighting.

Each jackolantern is illuminated by two LEDs. A candle-like flicker is added. Each jack-o-lantern can be a different color. Each LED is just chained together to the ends
of the other ones.
